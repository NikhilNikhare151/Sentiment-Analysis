# Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews using RNN

# Deep Learning Project | Natural Language Processing (NLP)

# Overview
This project performs Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The model classifies reviews into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments by analyzing textual data and extracting patterns using Word Embeddings and LSTMs.

# Dataset Details
The dataset consists of movie reviews labeled with sentiment categories.

# Key attributes:
Review Text – The actual user review of a movie.
Sentiment – Positive (2), Negative (0), or Neutral (1).

# Technologies & Tools Used
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn)
* Deep Learning Models (RNN, LSTM)
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Text Preprocessing, Tokenization)
* Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, or Embedding Layer)

# Results & Key Findings
The RNN model achieved high accuracy in classifying movie reviews.
Word Embeddings improved sentiment classification by capturing contextual meaning.
